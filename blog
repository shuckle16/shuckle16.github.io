<p> A thought-provoking study. "The researchers conclude that American universities missed 
out on a singular opportunity to boost mathematical knowledge because, had they accepted 
more doctoral students in response to the increased supply of Chinese applicants, the 
gains of Chinese professors would not have come at the expense of non-Chinese faculty." To me this 
paper contributes to the theory that mathematical research is a highly social process; communication and the
sharing of ideas are crucial to its success.</p>
