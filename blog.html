<h4>NBER article on Chinese Graduate Students</h4>
<p> A thought-provoking <a href="http://www.nber.org/digest/sep15/w21096.html">study</a>. &#8220;The researchers conclude that American universities missed 
out on a singular opportunity to boost mathematical knowledge because, had they accepted 
more doctoral students in response to the increased supply of Chinese applicants, the 
gains of Chinese professors would not have come at the expense of non-Chinese faculty.&#8221; To me this 
paper contributes to the theory that mathematical research is a highly social process; communication and the
sharing of ideas are crucial to its success.</p><span class="date">2/22/2016</span>

<h4>Wikipedia's Pokemon Test</h4>
<p>The Wikimedia blog reflected on the effect Pokemon has had on encyclopaedic knowledge in a recent 
<a href="http://blog.wikimedia.org/2016/02/26/pokemon-wikipedia-impact/">post</a>. Over its 20 year history, 
the Pokemon franchise has supplied us with an ever-growing heap of trivia, factoids, and backstories 
just waiting to be documented by the public---a cause for concern among &#8220;Exclusionists&#8221; in the Wikipedia community. </p>

<p>I am generally on the side of the exclusionists in this matter. Plenty of well-kept wikis for 
fans (see <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page">Bulbapedia</a>) exist and seem fit for this purpose. 
Admittedly, these sites vary wildly in quality and scope (not to mention the advertisement infestation).
Wikipedia has perhaps found a compromise by employing its love for comprehensive 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon">lists</a>. Will this be an effective long term solution?

<h4>The Civic Customers</h4>
<p>LA times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-buy-partisan-20140825-story.html">reported</a> on an app that 
promotes political transparency---to the granularity of a bar code. I applaud BuyPartisan&#8217;s efforts to help enlighten 
consumers and, unlike the LA times, am not worried about the possibility of increased polarization due to apps like 
this. If anything, they will help citizens understand that corporations are not simply partisan, they are 
self-interested agents that use political donations as a means to profit maximize. A general rule of thumb:
I am more concerned with the absolute dollar amount that a company devotes
to politics, not necessarily its shade of red or blue. Semi-related links

<p>As a side note, perhaps BuyPartisan could itself become more transparent
by shifting to an open source model?</p><span class="date">3/6/2016</span>
